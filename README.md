Atom is a Minecraft server core created by AtomicInteger which is based on [MinecraftForge](https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge) and [CraftBukkit](https://hub.spigotmc.org/stash/projects/SPIGOT/repos/craftbukkit/browse) for 1.12.2 version of Minecraft.
Also some parts of the code are taken from such project as [Spigot](https://hub.spigotmc.org/stash/projects/SPIGOT/repos/spigot/browse)
and its derivatives.

The code is from https://gitlab.com/AtomMC/Atom and its forks.

This project is not affiliated with shadowdan's development team.

Our main goals are:
1. Stable work with both Bukkit plugins and MinecraftForge mods support.
2. Highest performance possible.

## Installation

The Atom latest version can be dowloaded on the following page: http://josephworks.ddns.net:8080/job/AtomMC/job/master/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/build/libs/. 

Once the download is completed you have to follow the next steps:
1. Create a directory, where your future server will be located.
2. Put a jar file which ends with `-server.jar` and a `libraries` folder from artifacts.zip to this directory.
3. Launch the core using `java -jar` command.  
    Example (You may add optional flags): `java -jar Atom-*-*-server.jar`
    
## Building
